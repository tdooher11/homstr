		<h3>Q) WHAT ARE THE RULES FOR COMMENTING ON HOMES?</h3>
<p class="textABout"><strong>A)</strong> We ask that you use your best judgement at all times by being respectful to other members of the community and not using the site as an avenue for SPAM. We ask that you only comment on homes which you yourself have lived in or have had a close relative reside in the home and/or neighborhood which you are commenting on. Homstr prohibits users from adding personally identifiable information about anyone other than themselves.</p>
<h3>Q) HOW DO I COMMENT ON A HOME?</h3>
<p class="textABout"><strong>A)</strong>Simple, just search for the property or neighborhood you want to comment on from any of the pages with a search bar. Once the correct property is loaded, then you can begin your discussion.</p>
<h3>Q) DO I HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ANYTHING TO POST A REVIEW?</h3>
<p class="textABout"><strong>A)</strong> No. All you need to do in order to post your review or engage in a discussion is create a profile. You can quickly do this by using your Twitter or Facebook profile to activate your Homstr account. If you don’t have a Twitter or Facebook account, then you just need to complete a short form with your email address and name to begin engaging with other users on the site.</p>
<h3>Q) HOW DO I SHARE MY COMMENTS ON HOMSTR WITH OTHERS?</h3>
<p class="textABout"><strong>A)</strong> You can seamlessly post your Homstr review to your social media accounts like Google+, Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. This option is presented to you automatically after each comment you post on Homstr. If you do not use social media, then you are able to paste the link to the property you commented on into an email.</p>
<h3>Q) WHY AM I NOT ABLE TO REASEARCH HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS YET?</h3>
<p class="textABout"><strong>A)</strong>Like all review sites, it takes time to build up enough content from the community of users before everyone is able to use this information to influence their purchasing decisions. Please help speed this process up by sharing the site with your friends and family.</p>
<h3>Q) HOW DO I CONNECT WITH OTHER USERS ON HOMSTR?</h3>
<p class="textABout"><strong>A)</strong>Once you create a profile on Homstr, then you’re able to connect with other users on the site by adding them as your contact, engaging in a discussion, or you can even message them directly.</p>
